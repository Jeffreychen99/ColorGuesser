This is a simple game for iOS devices where the player tries to guess the RGB values of a random "mystery color" based on vision only. If the player successfully does so within the time interval, he/she will move on to the next level which has a smaller time interval for guessing.The app can be found on the appstore here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/color-guess/id1151184593?ls=1&mt=8

Have fun!
